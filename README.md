**BSV_Blockchain :**

Bitcoin SV (BSV) is a cryptocurrency and blockchain project that emerged as a result of a hard fork from the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain on November 15, 2018. BSV stands for "Satoshi Vision," and the project's primary goal is to maintain and scale the original vision of Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.

Key features and aspects of the BSV blockchain include:

1. **Bigger Blocks:** BSV focuses on larger block sizes to increase transaction throughput and scalability. This is in contrast to Bitcoin Core's approach, which advocates for smaller blocks to maintain decentralization.

2. **Satoshi's Vision:** BSV proponents argue that they are staying true to Satoshi Nakamoto's original whitepaper, which describes Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. We believe that BSV's approach aligns with this vision.

3. **Blockchain Scaling:** BSV aims to address scalability issues by increasing block sizes and enhancing the network's capacity to handle more transactions per second (TPS). This is done with the goal of facilitating global adoption and enabling microtransactions.

4. **Data Storage:** BSV allows for the storage of larger amounts of data on its blockchain. This opens up possibilities for applications beyond simple transactions, such as timestamping, data authentication, and notarization.

5. **Metanet Protocol:** BSV introduced the Metanet protocol, which envisions the creation of a blockchain-based internet where data, information, and digital assets are interlinked and directly transactable. It's essentially an internet built on top of the BSV blockchain.

6. **Miner-Focused:** BSV's approach places an emphasis on miners as network participants. Miners are responsible for processing and validating transactions, and they are rewarded with BSV tokens for their efforts.

7. **Partnerships and Developments:** BSV has been involved in various partnerships and projects aimed at demonstrating its capabilities.
